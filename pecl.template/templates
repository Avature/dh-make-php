Template: php/add_extension
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should ${extname} be added to /etc/php${phpversion}/${sapiconfig}/php.ini?
 You are installing ${extname} support for php${phpversion}, and it is not yet
 enabled in the configuration for the ${sapiconfig} SAPI.  Do you want
 this extension to be enabled now?

Template: php/remove_extension
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should ${extname} be removed from /etc/php${phpversion}/${sapiconfig}/php.ini?
 You are removing ${extname} support for php${phpversion}, but it is still enabled
 in the configuration for the ${sapiconfig} SAPI.  Leaving this in place
 will probably cause problems when trying to use PHP.
